# FLUX2 visual iteration v3

The user-supplied champion roster is the minimum expected visual baseline. The
procedural v2 catalog remains a technical integration scaffold and must not be
presented as accepted final art.

## Pipeline

| Phase | Operation | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Reference | Commit baseline and canonical briefs | Provenance and naming valid |
| Concept | Generate multiple edited candidates from the baseline | Structural score and contact sheet |
| Visual review | Compare expression, silhouette, material and charm | Every rubric item ≥4; mean ≥4.5 |
| Animation | Generate one animation/direction sheet at a time | Every keyframe reviewed |
| Extraction | Remove background and split exact grid | Pivot, alpha and clipping valid |
| Integration | Pack runtime frames and update catalog | Godot import and playback green |
| Promotion | Replace candidate status | Explicit visual acceptance only |

## Reference implementation concepts

The external `blendi-remade/sprite-sheet-creator` project demonstrates a useful
generation flow: a character reference is passed to an image-edit model, each
animation is generated as a compact grid, Bria removes the background, frames are
extracted with content bounds, and previews expose alignment problems. FLUX2 v3
uses those workflow ideas but adds canonical manifests, explicit call budgets,
five generated directions plus mirrored counterparts, 25 animation contracts,
96×96 runtime cells, per-item status, structural quality checks and fail-closed
promotion.
